## Project Name
Emacs editor
## General Info
Emacs is a feature-rich text editor popular with programmers and technical users. GNU Emacs is part of the GNU project and the most popular version of Emacs with a lot of development activity. The GNU Emacs manual describes it as "an extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time editor."

The original EMACS stands for, MACroS Editor for TECO. It was written in 1975 by Richard Stallman along with Guy Steele. It was inspired by the ideas of TECMAC and TMACS, a pair of TECO-macro editors written by Guy Steele, Dave Moon, Richard Greenblatt, Charles Frankston, and others. Many versions of EMACS have been released so far, but there are currently two that are commonly used: GNU Emacs, started by Richard Stallman in 1984, and XEmacs, a fork of GNU Emacs, which was started in 1991. GNU Emacs is implemented as an Emacs Lisp interpreter written in C, which has been extended with Lisp functions for editing text; so almost all Emacs code can be modified or extended in real time. This has allowed GNU Emacs to be extended with packages to cover all kinds of activity involving text: from writing, compiling, or interactively running programs for various computer languages, to checking e-mail, chatting, or surfing the Internet.

Some people make a distinction between the uppercase word "Emacs", used to refer to derived versions of the program created by Richard Stallman (particularly GNU Emacs and XEmacs), and the lowercase word "emacs", which is used to refer to the large number of Emacs implementations. The word "emacs" is often pluralized in English as emacsen by analogy with "oxen". For example, the Emacs compatible package for Debian is called emacsen-common. The only plural provided by the Collins English Dictionary is emacsen. 3

In the Unix culture, Emacs is one of the two main contenders in the traditional publisher wars, the other is vi.
