## Project Name
Vi editor
## General Info
The vi command starts the visual mode of ex, the landmark editing program developed by William Joy in the late 1970s. As ex gained popularity, Joy noticed that most users were exclusively using its visual mode, so to make things more convenient for his users, he added a link to ex which started it in visual mode automatically. Today vi is the most popular text editor among Linux users.

A more feature-rich implementation of vi named vim (which stands for "vi improved") is also available. For more information, please see our vim documentation.
